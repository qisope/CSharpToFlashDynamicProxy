CSharpToFlashDynamicProxy
=========================

Some more code saved because it was entertaining to write, and...different

Take a C# abstract class and dynamically create a runtime proxy which calls
through to a Flash ActiveX instance, also listen for calls from flash and invoke
The appropriate C# member.  More code I never expected to write for a project.
